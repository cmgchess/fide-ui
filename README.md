## FIDE Player Results Statistics
 A little improvement for the Results Statistics section of a FIDE profile. The Results Statistics section of a FIDE profile provides information about a player's performance in past chess games. However, when the opponent list is large, it can be difficult to find specific players. To make this process easier, I have added a search feature to the opponent list.
